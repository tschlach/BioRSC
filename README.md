# Suitability

In support of 3d design in Rhino and Grasshopper - this project provides a Python-based class structure that can be used to evaluate the suitability of any given point/window along a centerline curve as a location for a riffle of a given length.

Here we go - now we're talking.

Go into the drive on my local - make my edits and ship them out. But how do I make sure that I'm 'versioning' properly??

Ok - so slowly we're beginning to learn about what's going on here... I make the changes, I commit the changes to the master (or a branch) then I 'push' them to the repository...something like that...

Although, I guess I'm not sure how 'safe' this is - it doens't seem like I need any permissions - like anybody could just come in here and edit my repository...that's a little troubling...
