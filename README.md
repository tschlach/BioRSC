# BioRSC

In support of 3d design in Rhino and Grasshopper - this project provides a Python-based class structure that can be used to evaluate the suitability of any given point/window along a centerline curve as a location for a riffle of a given length.

Further development will implement this suitability assessment with the drawing of RSC concept designs (geometry) - and should be able to accept designer input for parameters, as well as output from the designs the attributes of the proposed structures.
