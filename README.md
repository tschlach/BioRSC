# BioRSC

In support of 3d design in Rhino and Grasshopper - this project provides a Python-based class structure that can be used to evaluate the suitability of any given point/window along a centerline curve as a location for a riffle of a given length.

Further development will implement this suitability assessment with the drawing of RSC concept designs (geometry) - and should be able to accept designer input for parameters, as well as output from the designs the attributes of the proposed structures.

## Current

-We currently have 4 file directories: Extra, Geometry, Suitability and Utilities.
-Extra: contains examples of work and walkthroughs
-Geometry: contains the scripts that will aid in the drawing of an RSC design (riffles, pools, benches)
-Suitability: contains the scripts that will assess the RSC stream/landscape to aid in the design decision making
-Utilities: contains scripts that will make assessments on the current and proposed stream/landscape, such as hydrological and cut-fill assessments 

#### Suitability Dir Tasks
This folder contains the following scripts: centerline, input, suitability, window - input and suitability need work.
-Add the additional attributes to the window class (top height etc.)


#### Software Design/Architecture Tasks
-Need to determine the riffle/pool 'relationship'
